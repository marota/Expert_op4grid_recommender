# --- GLOBAL MONKEY PATCH for grid2op 1.12+ compatibility ---
# PyPowSyBlBackend 0.3.0 and other backends might not initialize self._sh_vnkv,
# which is required by grid2op 1.12+ for grids with shunts. The patch below
# lazily initializes ``_sh_vnkv`` on the grid2op ``Backend`` base class the
# first time ``get_shunt_setpoint`` is called.
#
# grid2op is optional: when it is not installed the patch is a no-op. Any other
# failure is logged (debug level) to avoid surfacing noise at package import
# time, but is not swallowed by a bare ``except``.

# cheaper. Verified output-equivalent (same edges/hubs) on the RTE7000
# benchmark; x1.6 on the hotspot. Version-guarded and removable via
