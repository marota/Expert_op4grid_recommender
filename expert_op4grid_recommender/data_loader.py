    Loads action definitions from a specified JSON file.

    This function reads a JSON file expected to contain a dictionary

    Args:
        file_path (str): The full path to the JSON file containing the actions.

    Returns:

def load_interesting_lines(path=None, file_name=None):
    """
   Loads a list of line names from a file, typically used for monitoring or exclusion lists.

   This function acts as a wrapper around the `load_interesting_lines` function
   provided by the `expertop4grid` library (or its local copy within the utils).
   It reads a file (usually CSV) specified by either `path` and `file_name`
   or just `file_name` (if it's a full path or in the current directory)
   and returns a list of line names contained within.

   Args:
       path (str, optional): The directory path containing the file. Defaults to None.
       file_name (str, optional): The name of the file (e.g., "non_reconnectable_lines.csv").
                                   Can also be a full path if `path` is None. Defaults to None.

   Returns:
       list[str]: A list of line names read from the specified file.
