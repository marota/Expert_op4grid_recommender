        Computes a heuristic score for a node merging action based on the voltage angle
        difference (delta phase) between the two buses being merged.

        The bus connected to the red loop (carrying positive dispatch flow) is identified
        as the one with more positive capacity on its overflow graph edges.
        Its phase is theta1. The other bus has phase theta2.

        Score = theta2 - theta1. A positive score means flows would naturally go from
        the higher-phase bus (theta2) towards the lower-phase red loop bus (theta1),
        which is the desired direction to relieve overloads.
