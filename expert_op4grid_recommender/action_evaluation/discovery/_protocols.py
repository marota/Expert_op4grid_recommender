"""Structural contract the family mixins depend on (review A5).

The family mixins (``LineDisconnectionMixin``, ``PSTMixin``, the injection
mixins, …) are plain classes composed onto :class:`DiscovererBase` by
``ActionDiscoverer``; each reaches into ``self`` for shared state (the
observations, the ``FamilyResult`` store, the graph handles) and shared helpers
(the cache accessors, the memoised baselines) **without any of that being
declared anywhere** — a mixin's real dependencies were only discoverable by
reading its body. :class:`DiscovererProtocol` writes that contract down in one
place: it is exactly the surface a family mixin may assume ``self`` provides.

It is intentionally documentation-first (a mixin need not be annotated
``self: DiscovererProtocol`` to benefit), and ``@runtime_checkable`` so a test
can assert :class:`DiscovererBase` / ``ActionDiscoverer`` structurally satisfy
it — turning "the base grew a method a mixin needs but nobody noticed" into a
failing test rather than a runtime ``AttributeError`` deep in discovery.
