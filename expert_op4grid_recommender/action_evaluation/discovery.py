class ActionDiscoverer:
    """
    Discovers, evaluates, and prioritizes corrective actions for grid overloads.

    This class encapsulates the logic for identifying potential actions (line reconnections,
    disconnections, node merging, node splitting), scoring them heuristically, optionally
    simulating their effectiveness, and producing a prioritized list.

    It is initialized with the grid state, environment details, graph analysis results,
    and configuration parameters. The main method `discover_and_prioritize` orchestrates
    the analysis, calling specific methods for each action type. The results for each
    type are stored as attributes.

    Attributes:
        env: The Grid2Op environment instance.
        obs (Any): Observation before corrective action (for simulation).
        obs_defaut (Any): Observation after initial contingency (for context).
        action_space (Callable): Grid2Op action space function.
        timestep (int): Current simulation timestep.
        lines_defaut (List[str]): Lines defining the initial contingency.
        lines_overloaded_ids (List[int]): Indices of overloaded lines.
        act_reco_maintenance (Any): Action for maintenance reconnections.
        non_connected_reconnectable_lines (List[str]): Allowed lines for reconnection.
        all_disconnected_lines (List[str]): All currently disconnected lines.
        dict_action (Dict): Dictionary of candidate action descriptions.
        actions_unfiltered (Set[str]): Set of action IDs to consider.
        hubs (List[str]): List of hub substation names.
        g_overflow (OverFlowGraph): Processed overflow graph (integer nodes).
        g_distribution_graph (Structured_OverLoad_Distribution_Graph): Processed distribution graph.
        simulator_data (Dict): Data required by AlphaDeesp ranker.
        check_action_simulation (bool): Flag to enable/disable simulation checks.
        lines_we_care_about (Optional[List[str]]): Specific lines to monitor.

        # Results attributes (populated after running discover_and_prioritize)
        identified_reconnections (Dict): Identified reconnection actions.
        effective_reconnections (List): Effective reconnection line names.
        ineffective_reconnections (List): Ineffective reconnection line names.
        identified_merges (Dict): Identified node merging actions.
        effective_merges (List): Effective node merging actions.
        ineffective_merges (List): Ineffective node merging actions.

        ineffective_splits (List): Ineffective node splitting actions.

        Runs the full discovery and prioritization pipeline for all action types.

        This method coordinates the analysis by:
        1. Extracting necessary path information (dispatch lines/nodes, red loops, constrained lines/nodes)
           from the processed distribution graph and converting indices to names.
        2. Calling the specific evaluation method for each action type:
           - `verify_relevant_reconnections`
           - `find_relevant_node_merging`
           - `find_relevant_node_splitting`
           - `find_relevant_disconnections`
        3. Adding the identified actions from each step to the `prioritized_actions` dictionary,
           respecting the overall (`n_action_max`) and per-type (`n_reco_max`, `n_split_max`) limits.
