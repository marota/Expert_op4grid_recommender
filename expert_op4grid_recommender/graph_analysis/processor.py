    Determines which overloaded lines to consider for overflow graph analysis based on grid connectivity.

    This function analyzes whether disconnecting the specified overloaded lines would
    fragment the power grid into multiple connected components. The goal is to select
    a subset of overloads for the `Grid2opSimulation` such that the simulated
    disconnection doesn't immediately lead to an islanded grid, which would make
    topological solutions difficult or impossible.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Check if disconnecting *all* specified `lines_overloaded_ids` increases the
       number of connected components compared to the initial state.
       - If NO: Keep *all* `lines_overloaded_ids` for the overflow graph analysis.
    2. If YES (disconnecting all breaks the grid): Check if disconnecting *only* the
       line with the *maximum rho* among `lines_overloaded_ids` increases the
       number of components.
       - If NO (or if `force_keep_max_overload_id` is True): Keep *only* the line(s)
         with the maximum rho. This focuses the analysis on the most severe overload
         while avoiding immediate grid fragmentation. Also identifies substations islanded
         by disconnecting *all* overloads.
       - If YES (even disconnecting the single max overload breaks the grid): Return `None`
         for the lines to keep, indicating that the situation might require load shedding
         or other non-topological actions. Also identifies substations islanded by
         disconnecting just the max overload.

    Args:
        obs_simu (grid2op.Observation): The Grid2Op observation representing the current
            grid state (usually after an N-1 contingency).
        lines_overloaded_ids (list[int]): A list of integer indices for the lines initially
            identified as overloaded.
        force_keep_max_overload_id (bool, optional): If True, forces the function to keep
            at least the maximum overloaded line, even if disconnecting it alone would
            normally suggest the problem is topologically unsolvable. This might be useful
            if reconnectable lines could potentially bridge the gap later. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        tuple:

              of the overloaded lines recommended for inclusion in the `Grid2opSimulation`
              for building the overflow graph. Returns `None` if disconnecting even the
              single max overload fragments the grid (and force_keep is False).

              become islanded if the disconnections causing grid fragmentation were performed.

    and the "dispatch paths" (alternative routes where flow can be potentially redirected).

    Additionally, it performs a sanity check: if the analysis focuses on a subset of the
    originally identified overloads (`lines_overloaded_ids_kept` vs `lines_overloaded_ids`),
    it verifies that all original overloads are present within the identified constrained paths.
