    Constructs and refines an overflow graph based on a Grid2Op simulation state.

    This function simulates the disconnection of specified overloaded lines and uses the
    resulting changes in power flow (calculated by `Grid2opSimulation` from `alphaDeesp`)
    to build an initial overflow graph (`OverFlowGraph`). It then performs several optional
    refinement steps:
    1.  Inhibits legacy flow swapping behavior if requested.
    2.  Renames graph nodes from integer IDs to substation names.
    3.  Consolidates the graph using heuristics from `alphaDeesp` if requested.
    4.  Adds potentially relevant disconnected but reconnectable lines to the graph.

    Args:
        env (grid2op.Environment): The Grid2Op environment instance.
        obs_overloaded (grid2op.Observation): The observation object representing the grid
            state *before* disconnecting the overloaded lines (typically after an N-1 contingency).
        overloaded_line_ids (list[int]): List of integer indices of the lines considered
            overloaded and whose disconnection will be simulated.
        non_connected_reconnectable_lines (list[str]): List of line names that are currently
            disconnected but could potentially be reconnected.
        lines_non_reconnectable (list[str]): List of line names that are permanently
            disconnected or should not be considered for reconnection.
        timestep (int): The simulation timestep index.
        do_consolidate_graph (bool, optional): If True, applies graph consolidation heuristics.
            Defaults to True.
        inhibit_swapped_flow_reversion (bool, optional): If True, corrects potential flow
            direction swapping from older `alphaDeesp` logic. Defaults to True.
        node_renaming (bool, optional): If True, renames graph nodes from indices to
            substation names. Defaults to True.
        param_options (dict, optional): Configuration dictionary for the `Grid2opSimulation`
            (e.g., thresholds). Defaults to `PARAM_OPTIONS_EXPERT_OP` from config.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - df_of_g (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame detailing flow changes on lines after simulating
              the disconnection of `overloaded_line_ids`.
            - overflow_sim (Grid2opSimulation): The `alphaDeesp` simulation object used for
              calculating flow changes.
            - g_overflow (OverFlowGraph): The constructed and potentially refined overflow graph object.
            - real_hubs (list): List of nodes identified as hubs by `Structured_Overload_Distribution_Graph`
              before adding reconnectable lines.
            - g_distribution_graph (Structured_Overload_Distribution_Graph): The final `alphaDeesp`
              distribution graph object derived from the refined `g_overflow`.
            - node_name_mapping (dict): A dictionary mapping original node indices to substation names.
