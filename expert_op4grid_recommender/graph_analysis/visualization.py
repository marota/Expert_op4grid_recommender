    Loads voltage level information for substations from a PowSyBl network file.

    Generates and saves a visualization of the overflow graph with various annotations.

    This function takes a constructed overflow graph and enhances it with visual information
    before plotting and saving it as a PDF file. The enhancements include:
    - Coloring nodes based on substation voltage levels.
    - Annotating nodes with the number of connected electrical buses.
    - Highlighting hub nodes with a distinct shape.
    - Highlighting edges where flow direction might have been swapped.
    - Annotating edges with significant line loading changes (before vs. after overload disconnection),
      unless the simulation uses a DC power flow model.

    Args:
        env (grid2op.Environment): The Grid2Op environment object (used to get line names).
        overflow_sim (alphaDeesp.Grid2opSimulation): The alphaDeesp simulation object used to
            generate the graph, containing simulation results like `obs_linecut`.
        g_overflow (alphaDeesp.OverFlowGraph): The overflow graph object to be visualized.
            This object will be modified with annotations.
        hubs (list[str]):  A list of hubs to highlight with a specific shape (diamond)
        obs_simu (grid2op.Observation): The Grid2Op observation object representing the grid state
            *before* the simulated overload disconnection (used for 'before' line loading).
        save_folder (str): The path to the directory where the output PDF should be saved.
        graph_file_name (str): The base name for the output PDF file (without the extension).
        lines_swapped (list[str]): A list of line names where the flow direction might have
            been swapped during the overflow graph calculation.
        custom_layout (dict | list | None, optional): A predefined layout for positioning the graph nodes.
            Can be a dictionary mapping node names to (x, y) coordinates or a list of coordinates
            matching the node order. If None, the plotting function determines the layout.
            Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        svg: The SVG data generated by the `g_overflow.plot` method, if any. Note that the
             primary output is the saved PDF file.

    Side Effects:
        - Creates a temporary folder within `save_folder`.
        - Saves the graph visualization as a PDF file named `<graph_file_name>.pdf` in `save_folder`.
        - Deletes the temporary folder.
        - Prints the path to the saved PDF file to the console.
