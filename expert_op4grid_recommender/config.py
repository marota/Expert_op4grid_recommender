"""Pydantic-backed configuration module.

All runtime knobs used to live as bare module-level constants. They are now
validated by a :class:`Settings` (``pydantic_settings.BaseSettings``) class
and re-exported at module level for backwards compatibility, so existing
``from expert_op4grid_recommender.config import DATE`` and
``config.ENV_NAME = ...`` call sites keep working unchanged.

Every field on :class:`Settings` can be overridden at process startup via an
environment variable with the prefix ``EXPERT_OP4GRID_``, for example::

    EXPERT_OP4GRID_TIMESTEP=12 python -m expert_op4grid_recommender.main
    EXPERT_OP4GRID_LINES_DEFAUT='["BEON L31CPVAN"]' python ...

Lists and dictionaries accept JSON payloads from env vars;
``LINES_DEFAUT`` additionally accepts a bare line name.
